I'm a Ph.D. student in [Li Ding's Lab][dinglab] at Washington University in St. Louis. My research focuses on cancer protegenomics in two directions. I process and analyze [CPTAC proteognomic datasets][CPTAC] (mostly glioblastoma) to better understand the disease and potential treatments, and I also build tools and databases to assist the analysis.

You can find my academic publications [here][google scholar], or my CV [here](/CV.pdf).

Before graduate school, I interned in [Microsoft Research Asia][MSRA] and [Pinkoi], where I had a lot of fun in imaging deep learning and Chinese/Mandarin text search. I grew up in Taipei, Taiwan. Back in Taiwan, I went by liang<sup>2</sup> (pronounced as *liang-liang*). While in the United States, my lab calls me Bobo. I was offered with two options at the time, LB and Bobo, so [you know why][LB] I picked the latter :)

I was active in Taipei Python and R programming communities and enjoyed giving talks. You can find my previous talks [here][talks]. I give much less talks nowadays, mostly because I've been working on quite specific bioinformatic topics for a while so it's harder to find the audience. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my stuff and I'd love to share.

### How to pronounce my (nick)name?
To pronounce my nickname in Mandarin (*liang-liang*), just repeat [the same pronunciation][liang on wiktionary] *lia-ng* twice (Pinyin notation is liàng). [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/?hl=zh-TW#zh-CN/zh-TW/%E4%BA%AE%E4%BA%AE) pronounces it right. You can find out what *liang* means on [Wiktionary][liang on wiktionary] and [moedict][liang on moedict].

My Mandarin name is 王亮博. The three characters [王][wang on wiktionary]/[亮][liang on wiktionary]/[博][bo on wiktionary] maps to Wang/Liang/Bo, respectively (links have their individual meaning and pronunciation). Last name (王/Wang) goes first in Mandarin. [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com.tw/?hl=zh-TW#zh-CN/zh-TW/%E7%8E%8B%E4%BA%AE%E5%8D%9A) pronounces my full name right.
