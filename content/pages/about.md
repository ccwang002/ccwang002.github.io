Hi, I am Liang-Bo.
I also go by Bobo (and Liang-Liang in Mandarin).
Welcome to my personal blog :)

I am currently an Oncology Bioinformatics Scientist at Moderna working on personalized cancer vaccine (aka individualized neoantigen therapy, or INT).

I obtained my Ph.D. at Washington University in St. Louis under [Li Ding's Lab][dinglab].
Back then, my research focused on cancer protegenomics in two directions.
I processed and analyzed [CPTAC proteogenomic datasets][CPTAC] (mostly glioblastoma) to better understand the disease and potential treatments.
I also built some tools and databases to assist my analysis.

You can find my CV [here](/CV.pdf) and my academic publications [here][google scholar].

I grew up in Taipei, Taiwan.

Before my PhD, I interned at [Microsoft Research Asia][MSRA] and [Pinkoi].
I was active in Taipei Python and R programming communities and enjoyed giving talks.
You can find my previous talks [here][talks].
I give much fewer talks nowadays, mostly because the topics of my work has been quite domain specific.
Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my stuff and I'd love to share.
