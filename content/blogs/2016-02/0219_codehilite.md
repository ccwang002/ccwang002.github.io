Title: Add code block language name into CSS classes in Pelican Markdown

I used [Pelican] and its [Markdown] plugin to render blog post.

Recently I was playing with the [Python Official Documentation], which has a decent code syntax highlighter powered by [Pygments].

What's more, the output of code examples can be toggled. That is, a code example:

```python3
>>> print('Hello World')
Hello World
>>> 6 * 7
42
```

can be toggled to:

```python3
print('Hello World')

6 * 7

```

which is very convenient for code copy-pasting.

<del>However, the functionality is currently failed on the official Python doc (given by [`copybutton.js`](https://docs.python.org/3/_static/copybutton.js)) because the jQuery updates break previous API behavior. I've filed [issue 26246](http://bugs.python.org/issue26246) on the Python issue tracker for this problem.</del> (EDIT 2016-02-27: the patch has been merged.)

### Code output toggle in Pelican

After I fixed the copybutton.js, I wished to add this functionality to my blog.

Code highlighting in Pelican markdown files is handled by its [CodeHilite](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/code_hilite.html) extension. To my surprise, I found CodeHilite does not express the language name specified for each code block.

What I expected was

```html
<div class="highlight-python3">
    <div class="highlight">
        <pre>
            <!-- ... -->
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
```

but the actual output was

```html
<div class="highlight">
    <pre>
        <!-- ... -->
    </pre>
</div>
```

So no way to find the language name the code block used, nor the lexer aliases Pygments guessed when no language name was specified.

A quick dig into the [source code](https://github.com/waylan/Python-Markdown/blob/master/markdown/extensions/codehilite.py#L106-L123) showed that it is relatively easy to fix. Here is the diff:

```

I'm happy with the patched codehilite output. I am now able to give code toggle function to specific code languages.

However it's quite busy these days, so it may take a while to submit a proper pull request (e.g. fix any broken unit tests, write new tests, and tune the API as well as the new behavior). Moerover, **currently my site does not use jQuery** so I am missing a huge dependency. Rewriting it using vanilla JS seems to require considerable work, and the very thing I don't have at hand is time :(

I've decided to leave this improvement in future development. But if your site use Pelican Markdown and imports jQuery, the diff will add the code language back.
